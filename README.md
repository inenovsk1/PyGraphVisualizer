# PyGraphVisualizer
Python Graph Algorithm Visualizer Using Pygame.

# About Pygame
Pygame is a python library used for creating 2D and 3D games and applications. This program uses pygame as well, so before running it one must install pygame first. For more information on how to do that based on your platform please visit the [Getting Started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) pygame page. I have developed this application with pygame2 in mind and using version 2's documentation so it is preferable for one to use version 2 of the librray.

# Usage
Python version 3 is the recommended version to use when running this. File main.py provides a shebang, which defaults to the latest version of python 3 so one can simply run main.py in terminal like an executable:
```
./main.py [options]
```
For more detailed information regarding the options, type:
```
./main.py --help
```
